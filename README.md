# 🌾 AgriFlow Unveiled: Harnessing AI to Tackle Global Water Scarcity  
_Developed during the LJMU MSc Immersion Program, May 2025_

AgriFlow is a proof-of-concept (PoC) mobile application designed to tackle water scarcity in agriculture using AI. This prototype was developed collaboratively during the **Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) Immersion Program**, aligning with **SDG 6 – Clean Water & Sanitation** and **SDG 2 – Zero Hunger**.

## 🧭 Background

The project responds to the urgent need for sustainable water management in agriculture, where over **70% of freshwater** is consumed. Based on WHO projections, **half the world’s population will face water scarcity by 2025**. Conventional farming methods are static and ill-equipped to handle real-time climate fluctuations — increasing the risk of crop failure and resource waste.

---

## 🎯 Aim & Objectives

AgriFlow aims to empower farmers with:

- 📊 **Real-time monitoring** of groundwater, rainfall, and water quality
- 🤖 **AI-powered predictions** using LSTM and XGBoost models
- 🚨 **Risk alerts** (e.g., drought, salinity, waterlogging)
- 🌱 **Smart crop recommendations** for adaptive planning

---

## 🧪 Data & Methods

We sourced data from:

- 🛰 Government meteorological and water-level APIs  
- 📋 Direct farmer inputs (mocked in PoC)  
- 📈 AI models: **LSTM**, **XGBoost**, and **NLP-based language matching**

All data usage complies with ethical standards, including:
- Informed consent
- Anonymisation
- Accessibility in regional languages
- Bias audits for fairness

---

## 📲 Key Features

- 📉 Weekly dashboards of water trends  
- 🌿 Crop-switch alerts mid-season  
- 🌐 Interactive UI for low-literacy environments  
- 🚜 Localised adaptation based on zone-specific rainfall patterns
